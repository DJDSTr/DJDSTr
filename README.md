## Hey, I’m Boudy

I enjoy building small tools, experimenting with models, and trying out new ideas across different stacks. Most of my projects start as something I want to learn or automate, and I usually end up turning them into simple apps, scripts, or experiments.

### What I’ve been working with

* Python (Flask, small utilities, automation, model experiments)
* Godot (mostly C#)
* PyQt6 desktop apps
* LLMs — running, fine-tuning, and testing models locally
* Random experiments like wallpaper changers, loaders, plugins, and search tools

### Things I like building

* Lightweight desktop apps
* AI-related tools and scripts
* Small game prototypes
* Utility projects that make my workflow easier

### Current interests

* Fine-tuning models for specific tasks
* Creating custom compilers / DSLs for project automation
* Testing new LLMs and seeing how they handle practical tasks
* Learning more about AI agents
