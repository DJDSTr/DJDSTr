# Hey, I'm Boudy
I build small tools and experiment with whatever catches my interest. Most projects start because I want to learn something or automate something annoying.

## Things I've built

- Lightweight desktop apps  
- AI tools  
- Game prototypes  
- Custom plugins  
- Wallpaper changers  
- Automation scripts  

Basically anything that makes my workflow easier or teaches me something new.

## Right now I'm into

- Fine-tuning models for niche tasks  
- Building custom compilers/DSLs  
- Cybersecurity  
- AI agents
