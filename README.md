# Hey, I'm Boudy

I build small tools and experiment with whatever catches my interest. Most projects start because I want to learn something or automate something annoying.

## Things I've built
Mostly lightweight desktop apps, AI tools, game prototypes, and random utilities like wallpaper changers and custom plugins. If it makes my workflow easier or teaches me something new, I'll probably try building it.

## Right now I'm into
- Fine-tuning models for niche tasks
- Custom compilers and DSLs
- Cybersecurity
- AI agents
